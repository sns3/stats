/**
 * \ingroup aggregator
 * \brief Collector which converts input sample data to a different unit.
 *
 * ### Input ###
 * This class provides 9 trace sinks for receiving inputs. Each trace sink
 * is a function with a signature similar to the following:
 * \code
 *   void TraceSinkP (P oldData, P newData);
 * \endcode
 * where `P` is one of the 9 supported data types. This type of signature
 * follows the trace source signature types commonly exported by probes.
 * Although different data types are accepted, they are all internally
 * processed using `double` data type.
 *
 * ### Processing ###
 * This class provides 7 types of unit conversion procedure. It can be selected
 * by calling the SetConversionType() method or setting the `ConversionType`
 * attribute.
 * - `TRANSPARENT` (no conversion at all)
 * - `FROM_BYTES_TO_BIT`
 * - `FROM_BYTES_TO_KBIT`
 * - `FROM_BYTES_TO_MBIT`
 * - `FROM_SECONDS_TO_MS`
 * - `FROM_LINEAR_TO_DB`
 * - `FROM_LINEAR_TO_DBM`
 *
 * ### Output ###
 * This class utilizes 3 trace sources to export the converted data:
 * - `Output`: the converted old data and the converted new data (similar
 *   signature as probe's trace source, hence can be used to export to another
 *   collector).
 * - `OutputValue`: the converted new data.
 * - `OutputTimeValue`: the current simulation time and the converted new data.
 * All of the above information are exported using `double` data type in the
 * unit specified by the selected conversion type. An exception here is in the
 * trace source `OutputTimeValue` where the time information is exported in
 * unit of seconds by default, or as specified otherwise by calling the
 * SetTimeUnit() method or setting the `TimeUnit` attribute.
